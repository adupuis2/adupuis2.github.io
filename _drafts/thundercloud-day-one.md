First, a bit of information on the project: A friend's mother is going through a hard time, and just loves thunderstorms ("they're mother nature's music"). My friend showed me a sound-reactive cloud lamp, priced at $3000, that he said he wanted to get for his mom but couldn't afford. I offered to build one for her if he supplied the parts, and here we are.

The parts arrived a couple of days ago. It's always fun getting a package in the mail, especially when it's packed full of electronics.

Package contents:
- 2 Genuino Uno units
- 2 meters of 30px/m NeoPixel LED strip
- 25 2kÎ© resistors -- they're cheap and all of my resistors are jumbled together :<
- 1 830-point breadboard
- 1 Mini infrared remote control
- 1 Infrared receiver IC
- 1 Microphone preamp IC
- 1 5v10a PSU
- 1 switch

Everything else, I already had on hand.
